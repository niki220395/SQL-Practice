# SQL-Practice
Here you can find all exercises, queries and databases that I made during my learning about SQL and MySQL as RDBMS.

First I began with We3Scool (tutorial (https://www.w3schools.com/mysql/default.asp), exercices (https://www.w3schools.com/mysql/mysql_exercises.asp) and quiz (https://www.w3schools.com/mysql/mysql_quiz.asp)). Also I completed SQL for Beginners: Learn SQL using MySQL and Database Design course on Udemy and 
Programming with Mosh - MySQL Tutorial for Beginners (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S_tz1z_5bA&t=1464s).
